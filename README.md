# NeuroSINDy

## Overview
A library to do SINDy in an integrated environment across multimodal neural recordings, DBS control, and measurement errors.

## Requirements


## Installation


## Uses

### Tracking Dynamics (simulated)
One use case of this is to identify dynamics directly from raw neural recordings.
This is best illustrated in a simulated experiment

### Empirical Dynamics
Use of NeuroSINDy in empirical cases are more difficult, largely due to both the noise as well as the 'dimensional decompression'.
This use case relies on a different paper: Champion et al. 2019.
In this paper an extra layer is added.
The runtime expands from ~20 seconds in the above case to approximately 4 hours.
